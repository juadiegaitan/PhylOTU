1. Need to stitch blast hsps into a single hit for 16S locus trimming. (grab_SSU_reads)

2. parallelize align qc step.

3. get short reads working. Might be best to try expanding the volume in the reference database

4. Long branch attraction issues regarding root. How much of a concern is this?

5. Alignment qc appears to be conservative. Rebecca will send me an alignment

6. If only 1 read passes the qc, program dies. Can't execute tree prune on one read.

7. if SSU reads have same identifier, FastTree breaks. Build a check on this. 

8. FastTree can't handle colons. Maybe a warning @ start of code, ask users to ensure unique identifiers are formatted properly

9. V6 blast issue: STAP not enough seqs to find homology in variable regions

10. May want to collapse identical V6 tags, blast a representative

11. Fix cmscore printing. Email from Rebecca. Test the fix.

12. in run_otu_handler.sh:

 > logs/${JOB_ID}.all 2> &1

13. Fix HSP extraction process duing grab SSU sequences. Need to link HSP's together to get 16S boundary from read.
